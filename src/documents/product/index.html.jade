  h2 What is a cupcake ?
  p
    | A cupcake is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminium cup.
    | As with larger cakes, icing and other cake decorations, such as sprinkles, may be applied.

  h2 History

  p
    | The first mention of the cupcake can be traced as far back as 1796, when a recipe notation of "a cake to be baked
    | in small cups" was written in American Cookery by Amelia Simmons. The earliest documentation of the term cupcake
    | was in "Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats" in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's Receipts cookbook.

  p
    | In the early 19th century, there were two different uses for the name cup cake or cupcake. In previous centuries,
    | before muffin tins were widely available, the cakes were often baked in individual pottery cups, ramekins, or molds
    | and took their name from the cups they were baked in. This is the use of the name that has remained, and the name of
    | "cupcake" is now given to any small cake that is about the size of a teacup. While English fairy cakes vary in size
    | more than American cupcakes, they are traditionally smaller and are rarely topped with elaborate icing.

  p
    | The other kind of "cup cake" referred to a cake whose ingredients were measured by volume, using a standard-sized cup,
    | instead of being weighed. Recipes whose ingredients were measured using a standard-sized cup could also be baked in cups;
    | however, they were more commonly baked in tins as layers or loaves. In later years, when the use of volume measurements
    | was firmly established in home kitchens, these recipes became known as 1234 cakes or quarter cakes, so called because
    | they are made up of four ingredients: one cup of butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs.
    | They are plain yellow cakes, somewhat less rich and less expensive than pound cake, due to using about half as much
    | butter and eggs compared to pound cake. The names of these two major classes of cakes were intended to signal the method
    | to the baker; "cup cake" uses a volume measurement, and "pound cake" uses a weight measurement.
